Easily bulk rename files in ascending order
E.g you have a folder of images with weird names and would like them renamed from 1 to 100

How to run:
1. save file_renamer.sh 
2. open git bash
3. enter 'chmod +x file_renamer.sh' to make it executable
4. enter ./file_renamer.sh to run script (make sure you edit the filepath to your desired folder)

Adjust the file extension to your desired file type.
